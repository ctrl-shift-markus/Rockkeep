# Supported Versions

- STS: This version is only supported while it's the latest version. Once a new version is released, this version is dead.
- LTS: This version stays alive even after a newer version has been released for 1-4 releases.

Even if a version is dead, you can still use it as much as you want, it just means that you won't get patches and features.

| Version |  Support status     |
|-------- |---------------------|
| v1.0.0  |  LTS (2 releases)   |
